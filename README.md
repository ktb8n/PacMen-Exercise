TITLE:PacMen-Exercise

DESCRIPTION:
This code will add pacmen to the screen in random positions when "add" is pressed and animate them when "run" is pressed. "Clear" resets the page. Each pacman gets a unique starting position and velocity. I was given starter code for this exercise and was expected to edit it for functionality. 

TO RUN:
Download the code and run index.html in your browser. Press add and run to your heart's content. Note that every time you press run while pacmen are on the screen they speed up.

ROADMAP: 
Update the direction of the pacman so it appears as if it's changing directions. 
Add more buttons to change the illusion of the z-index of the pacmen (make them shrink and grow)
